/comment=REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
reference sequence was derived from Z84721.1, BC101846.1 and
AI064720.1.
This sequence is a reference standard in the RefSeqGene project.
On Aug 9, 2014 this sequence version replaced gi:14456711.
Summary: The human alpha globin gene cluster located on chromosome
16 spans about 30 kb and includes seven loci: 5'- zeta - pseudozeta
- mu - pseudoalpha-1 - alpha-2 - alpha-1 - theta - 3'. The alpha-2
(HBA2) and alpha-1 (HBA1) coding sequences are identical. These
genes differ slightly over the 5' untranslated regions and the
introns, but they differ significantly over the 3' untranslated
regions. Two alpha chains plus two beta chains constitute HbA,
which in normal adult life comprises about 97% of the total
hemoglobin; alpha chains combine with delta chains to constitute
HbA-2, which with HbF (fetal hemoglobin) makes up the remaining 3%
of adult hemoglobin. Alpha thalassemias result from deletions of
each of the alpha genes as well as deletions of both HBA2 and HBA1;
some nondeletion alpha thalassemias have also been reported.
